# Recurrent Mixture Density Networks (RMDN)

Project carried out for the course _02456 Deep Learning_ at the Technical University of Denmark by Peter MÃ¸rch Groth.

## Contents

The main RMDN is trained in the `main.ipynb`-notebook. The model is contained in the `model.py`-script. The baseline GMM and MDN are trained and tested in the `baselines.ipynb`-notebook. Various visualisations are created in the `visualisations.ipynb`-notebook which uses functions from the `util.py`-script. Data pre-processing is carried out in - you guessed it - the `data_rpeprocessing.ipynb`-notebook. The saved models and their training and validation log-likelihoods can be found in the `models` folder.
